This is a CLI app for managing an imaginary store called Bamazon.

The app begins by prompting users on what view they would like to access- Customer, Manager or Supervisor. 

##Customer
The Customer view allows users to see available items for sale as well as their prices. Users will then chose the quantity and id of the item they would like. If the quantity is in stock users will see the amount owed otherwise they will be alerted that there is not enough in stock.
